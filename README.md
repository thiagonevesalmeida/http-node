### Project Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to create a complete development environment using only native Node.js resources. Here are the main objectives:

- **Server:** The project begins with the creation of a backend server that serves static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the `http` module. This provides a solid foundation for hosting web content.

- **Web Frontend:** In addition to serving static files, the project includes a public or web frontend. This allows users to interact with the application through a simple web interface. Including a frontend demonstrates how to integrate server logic with the user interface.

- **API (Application Programming Interface):** The project extends the server's functionality by adding an API that allows programmatically adding and removing URLs. The API is implemented as part of the backend server and follows basic RESTful practices. This illustrates how to create a server API using native Node.js modules.

### Project Structure

The project structure consists of the following elements:

- **Backend:** The backend server is implemented in `server.js` and uses the `http` module to handle HTTP requests. It serves static files from the `web` directory and offers an API for URL manipulation.

- **Frontend:** The frontend is represented by static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) stored in the `web` directory. This enables users to access the application through a web browser.

- **API:** The API is integrated into the backend server and offers three main endpoints: `GET /` to retrieve all URLs, `POST /` to add URLs, and `DELETE /` to remove URLs.

### Customization

You can customize this project in various ways:

- Add more functionality to the API.
- Customize the frontend to meet your user interface needs.
- Expand the backend server to handle additional types of requests and resources.

This project serves as a starting point for creating a complete Node.js application with all essential parts üöÄ.
